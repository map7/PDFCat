* PDFcat

PDFcat is a document management system to be ran on your lan. The idea is that you setup your scanner to scan to the upload directory and then catalogue the result though the web interface.

** Installation

Tested using Debian 7 stable.

1. Install requirements
   : sudo apt-get install pdftk texlive-extra-utils

2. Install postgresql
   : sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev

3. Create pdfcat role
   : sudo su postgres
   : createrole <your user>
   : exit

4. Install ruby 1.8
   : sudo apt-get install ruby1.8 rubygems1.8

5. Install bundler
   : sudo gem install bundler

6. Clone this repository

7. Install required gems
   : cd pdfcat
   : bundle

8. Edit the db/database.yml & change username to your username

9. Create database
   : rake db:create
   : rake db:migrate
   : rake db:seed

10. Start server
    : script/server

** Usage

1. Install on a production server within your network
2. Create an storage & upload directory eg: /home/<user>/upload & /home/<user>/storage
3. Use samba to share the upload directory to the network
4. Point your PDF scanner to the upload directory
5. Do a test by scanning to the upload directory and catalogue the result

** OCR

I use [[http://www.abbyy.com.au/ocr-sdk-linux/][Abbyy FineReader Engine for Linux]]. You have to have a license from them to use this product.

I've created a simple rake task to do the OCR at night as it can use a lot of resources. As I have only brought a 12,000 page a year license I've coded my rake task to do 20 pdfs a night. (Most of my pdfs only have 1 page so this is ok). This means I most likely won't go over my yearly quota.

To use do the following
1. Purchase a license
2. Add the following to your crontab
   : 00	0	* * *	root	/bin/bash -c 'cd /var/www/pdfcat_app/current; export RAILS_ENV=production; bundle exec rake pdfs:ocr'
   I use rbenv so mine looks like so;
   : 00	21	* * *	map7	/bin/bash -c 'export HOME="/home/map7";export PATH="/usr/local/rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; cd /var/www/pdfcat_app/current; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; export RAILS_ENV=production; bundle exec rake pdfs:ocr'
